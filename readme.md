[**remark**][remark] plugin to add break support, without needing spaces.

## Note!

This plugin is ready for the new parser in remark
([`micromark`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark),
see [`remarkjs/remark#536`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/pull/536)).
A patch version was released (`2.0.1`) that works with old and new remark.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c):
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `import`ed instead of `require`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-breaks
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.md` (note: there are no spaces after
`a`):

```markdown
This is a
paragraph.
```

And our module, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```js
import {readSync} from 'to-vfile'
import {unified} from 'unified'
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse'
import remarkBreaks from 'remark-breaks'
import remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'

const file = readSync('example.md')

unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkBreaks)
  .use(remarkRehype)
  .use(rehypeStringify)
  .process(file)
  .then((file) => {
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```html
<p>This is a<br>
paragraph.</p>
```

Without `remark-breaks`, you’d get:

```html
<p>This is a
paragraph.</p>
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkBreaks`.

### `unified().use(remarkBreaks)`

Plugin to add break support without needing spaces.
This adds support for GitHub style (in issues, pull requests, comments, and
releases) hard breaks without needing spaces before newlines.

## Security

Use of `remark-breaks` does not involve [**rehype**][rehype] ([**hast**][hast])
or user content so there are no openings for [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss]
attacks.
